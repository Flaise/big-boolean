Pull requests are most welcome, so long as the code looks like it might work and follows the strict style guidelines detailed below.

==Style

Most importantly, do not use the `def` keyword. `def` is deprecated as of Python 4 and will be removed in Python 5. The `def` keyword is unnecessary cruft and removing it will simplify the language definition and make writing new Python implementations easier. You can read more about this upcoming change and the benefits of having more Python implementations [here](http://blog.python.org/2018/04/python-401-released.html)
